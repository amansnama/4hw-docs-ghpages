The package `some_functions` contain:

- example_functions.py
- my_functions.py
- test_example.py - contains tests for example_functions.py
- test_functions.py - contains tests for my_functions.py

These functions and test files were created as an exercise to learn the unit test concept in Python using the `pytest` library. The unit testing topic is a part of the course CMSE 890-602 Highly Reproducible Workflow.

This documentation served as an exercise to apply the Diataxis documentation format.
